What is Operating System?
++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
O.S is a collection of programs that co-ordinates the operation of computer hardware and software.
 
it's an interface between user and the Computer Hardware resources. 
It manages hardware resources and provides a platform for running application software
The computer only understands 0's and 1's as Language.

Functions of O.S
++++++++++++++++
1. Process mgt
2. Memory mgt
3. I/O mgt
4. Data mgt

Linux Kernel
+++++++++++++
A set of functions that make up the heart of an O.S.
It is used to provide an application interface between a program and the physical devices.

Services provided by the Kernel
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Controls execution of processes
2. Scheduling processes fairly for executions on the CPU
3. Initiating memory for an application
4. File System Management
5. Device management
6. Process management
7. System Calls / Interface: Provides a way for user programs to interact with hardware through system calls (API between user space and kernel space)
8. Security and Access Control: Manages user authentication and permissions & Enforces access control policies

What is Shell: Its an interface between the user and the kernel.
+++++++++++++

Services provided by the Shell:-
1. It interpretes all the commands to the kernel
2.The kernel after processing the the commands gives back to the shell.

To know the available shells: 
$ cat /etc/shells

To see login shell 
$ echo $SHELL  
/bin/bash

To change shell:
#csh
#ksh

iv. c-shell (csh) -- to write c , c++
v. Tcshell (tsh) -- to write c , c++

   and etc..


Types of Operating System.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1.Single User-Single Tasking Operating System
2.Single User-Multi Tasking Operating Sytem
3.Multi User-Multi Tasking Operating System

1.Single User-Single Tasking Operating System - An operating System where only one user can log on to the system and can perform only one task  E.g MS-DOS
2.Single User-Multi Tasking Operating System - Only one user can log on to the system but can peform multiple tasks at a time, e.g browsing the internet while playing songs. E.g Windows-xp, Windows-7, Windows-8
3.Multi User-Multi Tasking Operating System- This type of OS provides multiple users to log into the system and also each user can perform various tasks at a time E.g UNIX, Linux, Windows server

LINUX and UNIX features:
+++++++++++++++++++++++

its very secure
Its Virus Free 
its portable
multiuser
multitasking 
Scalability
Reliability - Biggest servers runs on it
Security - Inbuilt firewalls (iptables)
Its fast in processing (speed) and etc...

LINUX PRINCIPLES
-Everything is a File
